# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand its structure, detect patterns, and identify important features using statistical and visual techniques.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Titanic Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly (optional)

## Key Steps
1. **Data Overview**: Loaded dataset, checked shape, types, and missing values.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Used `describe()` to get summary metrics.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Histograms and Boxplots for numeric feature distributions
   - Correlation Matrix and Pairplot to examine relationships
4. **Insights**:
   - Detected outliers in 'Fare' and 'Age'
   - Found skewed distributions
   - Observed survival rate differences by gender and class

## Outcome
This analysis helped understand the dataâ€™s key characteristics, identified relationships between features, and set the stage for effective data preprocessing and modeling in future tasks.
